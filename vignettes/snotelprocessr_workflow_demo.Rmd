## Welcome to snotelprocessr!

Thanks for using snotelprocessr! This package was designed for the large-scale processing of SNOTEL station data. If you have any questions about use or troubleshooting, feel free to email me, Ally Detre, at a.detre\@colostate.edu.

The following will include a sample workflow for downloading, processing, and exporting SNOTEL station data:

## Download (daily) raw SNOTEL data:

```{r}
# Supply the function with a tibble of state/site IDs:
df <- tibble(site = c(531, 335, 505, 485, 802),
state = c("CO" ,"CO", "CO", "CO", "CO"))

# Set your output directory
snotel_dir = "path/to/directory"

# Using walk2, from purrr package for a tibble/df of sites:
walk2(.x = df$site, .y = df$state, ~snotel_downloader_daily(site = .x, state=.y,
start_date = "2013-01-01", end_date = "2015-12-31", save_dir = snotel_dir))

### Note that this downloads daily data, hourly data can be accessed with snotel_downloader_hourly
```

Great! Now we have our daily data, but it needs some cleaning up.

## Process raw SNOTEL data:

```{r}
# First, define input and output folders:

# input: where raw data is located
input_folder <- "your/input/path"

# output: where processed data will go
output_folder <- "your/output/path"

# Create output folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(output_folder)) {
  dir.create(output_folder, recursive = TRUE)
}
```

Now that we've set up folder paths, it's time to process the data with a for loop that effectively grabs every CSV file in your input folder and renames the columns, converts to metric units, calculates derivatives and densities, and identifies soil moisture pulses. Note: the parameters fed into soil moisture pulse detection can be changed!

```{r}

# List csv files in input_folder
file_list <- list.files(input_folder, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

for (file_path in file_list) {
  # Read CSV
  df <- read.csv(file_path, fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
  
  # Apply processing functions (from snotelprocessr)
  df <- df %>%
    snotel_rename_col_daily()
  
  # Remove years with only NA values in soilm_p2 column
  ### comment out these lines if soil moisture is not a concern
  df <- df %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    filter(!all(is.na(soilm_p2))) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  # Apply rest of processing functions (from snotelprocessr)
  df <- df %>%
    snotel_metric() %>%
    snotel_density_calculation() %>%
    fill(soilm_p2, .direction = "down") %>%  # Down fill any NAs in soil moisture before derivative calculations
    snotel_derivative(soilm_p2)
  
  # Find DOY of peak SWE
  df <- df %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    mutate(
      peak_swe = ifelse(any(!is.na(swe) & doy <= 182), doy[which.max(ifelse(doy <= 182, swe, NA_real_))], NA_real_)
    ) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  # Find soil moisture pulse dates for each year
  ### ***CHANGE PARAMS AS NEEDED*** ###
  pulse_results <- snotel_detect_smpulse(
    df = df, 
    soil_moisture_col = "soilm_p2", 
    doy_col = "doy", 
    year_col = "year", 
    swe_col = "swe", 
    min_swe_window_before = 70, 
    max_swe_window_after = 30,
    variability_multiplier = 1.25, 
    derivative_length = 2
  )
  
  # Merge pulse results df back into the main df
  df <- df %>%
    left_join(pulse_results, by = "year") %>%
    mutate(sm_pulse_flag = if_else(doy == doy_pulse, 1, 0, missing = 0)) %>%  # Create binary column for pulse DOY
    select(-doy_pulse)  # Remove the doy_pulse column
  
  # Create output filename
  base_name <- sub("\\.csv$", "", basename(file_path))
  output_path <- file.path(output_folder, paste0(base_name, "_processed.csv"))
  
  # Write processed SNOTEL data to output folder
  write.csv(df, output_path, row.names = FALSE)
}
```

Now that we have processed data, we can handle the SNOTEL data with ease. You can check out the following R scripts in the "vignettes" folder for further processing and analysis:

-   extract_snotel_peak_swe.R

    -   Extract peak SWE day of year (DOY) from your processed SNOTEL data. Returns a CSV file with peak SWE DOY for each year/station

-   extract_snotel_soilmoisture_pulse.R

    -   Extract soil moisture pulse DOY from your processed SNOTEL data. Returns a CSV file with soil moisture DOY for each year/station

-   export_snotel_soilmoisture_plots.R

    -   Create and export faceted plots for your processed SNOTEL data. These plots will show soil moisture curves with plotted pulse dates, in addition to SWE and derivative curves for context:

        ![](images/CO_531.png)

-   compute_snotel_snowfree.R

    -   Computes snow presence and snow-free DOY based on observations of snow depth.

-   compute_50p_peakSWE_window.R

    -   Computes 50% peak SWE DOY for each year (in other words- what DOYs the SWE curve crosses 50% of peak SWE)
